Mapping,Creating this page allowed me to practice my data processing skills in Javascript as well as implementing the Leaflet library to create an interactive map. I use crowdsorced mass shooting data to create an informative graphic of the mass shootings that occurred in the U.S. up until 2016. The user can filter the data shown on the map and click on each data point to find out more information about it.,mass-shootings.png,https://students.washington.edu/lac29/info343/a3-mapping-constancela/
